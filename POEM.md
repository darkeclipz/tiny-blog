In the realm of bytes and code,
Where digital dreams are often sowed,
Lives a tool both small and grand,
A blog engine, crafted by hand.

Whispers of the keyboard's dance,
Inspire posts that take a chance,
Lines of Markdown, pure and bright,
Transform to pages, day and night.

Tinyblog, with humble might,
Guides the writer's endless flight,
Through simple scripts and elegant flair,
It builds a world with utmost care.

A command line, clear and bold,
Helps stories, tales, and truths unfold,
With each "init," a fresh new start,
A canvas for the writer's heart.

Highlight.js to light the way,
For coders who have much to say,
MathJax weaves its magic spell,
To show equations, crisp and well.

Mermaid charts in flowing streams,
Bring to life the diagrammed dreams,
Every post, a crafted jewel,
With themes that make the simple cool.

In folders neat, the content lies,
Settings, sources, all that ties,
The engineâ€™s hum, a gentle song,
To which each blog will soon belong.

So here's to tinyblog's domain,
Where words and wisdom freely reign,
A micro marvel, strong and free,
Empowering voices, endlessly.
